## Data Product 101

---

### üìö Definition

* Self-contained data that's discoverable.
* It's limited in scope and it's based in an specific **domain**
* It's a **product** because it's a deliverable that's used by other people.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Structure

| Component         | Description                                                                                                                          |
|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Data**          | Raw data, processed data, metadata, etc.                                                                                             |
| **Specification** | A declarative way to express what's this self-contained product (data).                                                              |
| **Input Ports**   | Describe the way that interacts with its sources (other data product's `output` ports                                                |
| **Output Ports**  | Describe the way that interacts with its consumers (other data product's `input` ports                                               |
| **Control ports** | Special ports that describe cross-functional aspects such as: `observability`, `SLO(s)`, `governance`, `compliance`, etc.            |
| **Metadata**      | Relevant metadata useful in the context of the product and its domain (or bounded context for other domains that are related to it). |

## üìö Data Product Architecture

### üé® Simplified architecture

### Layers

* **Data ingestion layer**: It's responsible for ingesting the data from the **input ports**. It can be a **streaming** or **batch** process.
* **Transformation or processing layer**: It's the layer that actually transform (most likely an ETL process) the data obtained from the ingestion layer. If no transformation is performed, it's the layer that store the data into the _data lake_ on its more "raw" state (_non refined state_). E.g.: An S3 bucket normally called "raw zone".
* **Data lake**: It's the layer that store the data.
