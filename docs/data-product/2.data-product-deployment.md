## Deployment of Data Product

It refers to the process where the [data product](./1.data-product-architecture.md) is provisioned as a self-contained and deployable artifact.

### Provisioning

* The `specification` of the data product is used to provision the data product.
* The underlying `infrastructure` utility plan provide the infrastructure/platform capabilities (E.g.: automations through managed by  IAC tools that implements services in a ☁️ cloud service provider).
* The **deployment pipeline** performs the actual provisioning of the data product, ensuring security and compliance requirements.

>**NOTE**: The **governance** has a role in this deployment pipeline, ensuring that the process is reliable, secure and compliant.
